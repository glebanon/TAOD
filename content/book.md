A few years ago I was teaching probability theory at Purdue to undergrads and at the same time I was training several ML graduate students in probability and statistics. I wrote the book below with the intention of adding more volumes that include statistics and machine learning but did not get a chance to do so yet.

* The content is almost self-contained and includes mathematical prerequisites and basic computing concepts.
* The R programming language is used to demonstrate the contents. Full code is available, facilitating reproducibility of experiments and letting readers experiment with variations of the code.
* The presentation is mathematically rigorous, and includes derivations and proofs in most cases.
* The book is available through [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Analysis-Data-Guy-Lebanon/dp/1479344761) or in HTML form via this [single panel viewer](http://theanalysisofdata.com/probability/0_2.html) or via this [double panel viewer](http://theanalysisofdata.com/probability/viewer2.html).

I also have several sample chapters from the unfinished second volume on computing (with Mohamed El-Geish):

* [Introduction to R](http://theanalysisofdata.com/computing/R.pdf)
* [Data Visualization](http://theanalysisofdata.com/computing/Data Visualization.pdf)
* [Data Processing](http://theanalysisofdata.com/computing/data_processing.pdf)

Additional teaching notes are available [here](../notes/).
